# Greenfield Traders Webshop

A fully functioning dummy webshop with fake products built in a team of two (Moritz Georgy & Christian Greenfield) 

The shop includes: 

1) A Login/ Signup System 
2) User accounts with their associated data than can be modified. Addresses, payments and personal information. 
3) A Shopping Cart.
4) A Favorites List.
5) An overview of past orders.
6) A search bar.
7) Changing curreny feature. 
8) A full checkout process that processes and validates user data and triggers an email send after a purchase was completed. 

Also the webshop is fully responsive and usable on mobile devices. 

After cloning the repository, if you want to run it on your machine, follow the following steps: 

## Installing the Angular CLI
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
